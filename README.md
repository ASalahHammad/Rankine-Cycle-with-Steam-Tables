# Rankine Cycle with Steam Tables
# My Email: Ahmad25.2.2002@gmail.com
## There aren't any licenses of any kind to this code, until now..., but read the license of the steam tables in the 'README.md' files in the folders: "rankine_cycle_cpp" or "rankine_cycle_matlab"
## Although I love c++ more than matlab, the matlab code is less complicated, with less lines of code and less errors.
