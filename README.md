# Rankine Cycle with Steam Tables

## There aren't any licenses of any kind to this software...
## Please Read the "README.md" files inside either of the folders "rankine_cycle_cpp" or "rankine_cycle_matlab"
## Although I love c++ more than matlab, the matlab code is less complicated, with less lines of code and less errors.
